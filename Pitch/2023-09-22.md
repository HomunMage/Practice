1 / 1

**Audience Member 1 (AM1)**: How do you plan to handle the balance between Liliana and Jalen in gameplay? In many dual-protagonist games, players end up favoring one character over the other.

**Game Producer (GP)**: Excellent question. We've designed their abilities to be complementary. While Liliana might excel in areas with more aerial challenges and Jalen in regions requiring in-depth mining or magic, they both will have equally compelling narratives and skills. We're also introducing challenges that can only be solved by combining their unique abilities, encouraging players to master both characters.

---

**Audience Member 2 (AM2)**: The game seems story-rich. But how do you ensure that players who are more into action or exploration won't feel bogged down by the narrative?

**GP**: Our design philosophy emphasizes player choice. While _Eclipsed Aetheria_ boasts a deep narrative, players can choose their engagement level. For those who love the lore, there are detailed quests and side stories. Players more into action or exploration can focus on battles, crafting, or discovering hidden areas of Aetheria without diving too deep into every subplot. The narrative is there to enrich the experience, but the player dictates their journey's pace.

---

**Audience Member 3 (AM3)**: With the in-game store and DLCs, how do you plan to ensure that the game doesn't become "pay-to-win"?

**GP**: That's a core principle for us. All items in the in-game store are purely cosmetic. They won't give any player an advantage in gameplay. As for DLCs, they're designed to expand the world and story, offering new experiences rather than advantages. The base game will be a complete, fulfilling experience on its own. Our monetization strategies will never compromise the integrity of gameplay.

---

**Audience Member 4 (AM4)**: Multiplayer games require robust servers and regular updates. How do you plan to address potential technical issues or bugs that might arise?

**GP**: We've invested in top-tier server infrastructure to ensure smooth gameplay. Our team will actively monitor for issues post-launch. We'll also have a dedicated portal for players to report bugs. Regular patches are planned, not just for bug fixes but also to introduce fresh content and keep the game experience vibrant. Our commitment is to provide a seamless multiplayer experience and swift responses to any technical challenges.

---

**Audience Member 5 (AM5)**: How do you plan to handle toxic behavior in multiplayer mode?

**GP**: A healthy community is vital for _Eclipsed Aetheria_. We'll implement a robust reporting system, active moderation, and penalties for toxic behavior. Additionally, we're exploring features like a positive reinforcement system, where players get rewarded for being helpful or collaborative. We aim to foster a welcoming environment for all our players.
